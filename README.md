This is currently being used for a project I haven't had time to complete. I will be using the JSON hosted here to get timezone information across the globe for the C# Outlook VTSO app I am making. This app will be made with the focus of making it easier for people in business to save timezone information for each contact they have in addition to comparing their timezones to ensure that when they schedule a meeting it will fit within an acceptable window for both themselves and the other participants. This project was brought on by a need from my father who works in sales and has to coordinate with people from across the globe.
